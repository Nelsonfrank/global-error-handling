## Error handling in React

Simple Todo app with global error handling functionality

we are going to use new react life cycle `componentDidCatch` method.

errorBoundary(also as global error handling component) component should be class component, so that we can use `componentDidCatch` lifecycle method to catch error and connect with external log management platform.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
